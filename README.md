# Design

### Typography

Josefin Sans was chosen for the navbar and headers, as its sleek design harmonizes with the overall style. Meanwhile, Montserrat was specifically selected for paragraphs and price lists due to its clear presentation, ensuring optimal readability for users navigating through the content.

## Features:

### Navbar

The navbar is intentionally designed to be both visually appealing and functional. It runs with the colour scheme of the website, in the overall design. One notable feature of the navbar is its hover effect, which enhances user interaction. When a user hovers over a navigation link, it dynamically changes color to white, providing visual feedback and highlighting the selected option.

### Footer

By opting for a minimalist approach in designing the footer, I intentionally refrained from cluttering it with unnecessary elements. Instead, I focused solely on including links to the brand's social media pages.
