# Design:

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is based on the clients favourite colour of green. On a black background it brings out the green which really catches the eye.

### Typography

Josefin Sans was chosen for the navbar and headers, as its sleek design harmonizes with the overall style. Meanwhile, Montserrat was specifically selected for paragraphs and price lists due to its clear presentation, ensuring optimal readability for users navigating through the content.

### Wireframes

The wireframes were designed as a guide on how I want my website to look. There were some changes made in the final outcome of website.

## Features:

### Navbar

The navbar is intentionally designed to be both visually appealing and functional. It runs with the colour scheme of the website, in the overall design. One notable feature of the navbar is its hover effect, which enhances user interaction. When a user hovers over a navigation link, it dynamically changes color to white, providing visual feedback and highlighting the selected option.

### Footer

By opting for a minimalist approach in designing the footer, I intentionally refrained from cluttering it with unnecessary elements. Instead, I focused solely on including links to the brand's social media pages.

## Testing:

During testing I found that my images weren't responding on my deployed website. I found that I had a (/) before the assets image link. This was removed and images were loading correctly.

Also my hero image wasn't responsive, so i got around this by adding the following media query.
